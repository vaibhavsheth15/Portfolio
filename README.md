## Projects
#### Movie Recommendation System
- Developed a movie recommendation system using a combination of machine learning algorithms, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and matrix factorization.
- The system was built and trained on a large dataset of movies, comprising 100,000 ratings from 1,000 users.
- Preprocessed and cleaned the movie dataset using Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy.This involved removing 5% of missing data and eliminating 500 duplicate entries.
- The system successfully provided relevant movie suggestions, with an average precision of 85%and recall of 92% across different users.
#### Airline Passenger Satisfaction Prediction
- Performed preprocessing on the dataset, handling missing values by imputing them using appropriate techniques. Approximately 10% of the data had missing values, which we successfully addressed.
- Developed and trained various machine learning models, including linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks, to predict passenger satisfaction based on input features.
- Achieved an accuracy rate of 85% in predicting passenger satisfaction using the trained models.
- Utilized cross-validation techniques to assess the performance of the models and ensure generalizability. The models consistently achieved an average cross-validation accuracy of 82%.
